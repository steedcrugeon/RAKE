General Science Notes for the GoingUndground Kerbal Space Program Mod

These notes are for support of the development collaboration and references purposes.
Notes are written based aorund KSP 1.6.1 (version used at time of development).
No additional '.dll' files are required to use the science associated with this mod
The design aim for GoingUndground is to be compatible with the 'Stock' game.

Background: GoingUndground is a KSP mod which adds 'subterranean habitats' to the game
which includes parts, and science! These are intended for mid - late game use.

Three type of Science Definition File 'suffix'; Basic , Detailed and Exhaustive.
It should be noted that for the purposes of this mod we are only intersted in 'SrfLanded'
there will be no science conducted in space or atmospheric flight.

		EveSrfLanded = #autoLOC_501404 //#autoLOC_501404 = The surface appears to have a very strong purple tint to it... or is it grey and it just looks purple because everything else on Eve is? You start to wonder if you're not taking on a purple tint yourself.
